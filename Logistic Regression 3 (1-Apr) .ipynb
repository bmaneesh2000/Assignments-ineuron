    "Logistic Regression is a statistical analysis model that attempts to predict precise probabilistic outcomes based on independent features. On high dimensional datasets, this may lead to the model being over-fit on the training set, which means overstating the accuracy of predictions on the training set and thus the model may not be able to predict accurate results on the test set. This usually happens in the case when the model is trained on little training data with lots of features. So on high dimensional datasets, Regularization techniques should be considered to avoid over-fitting (but this makes the model complex). Very high regularization factors may even lead to the model being under-fit on the training data.\n",

So the transformation of non linear features is required which can be done by increasing the number of features such that the data becomes linearly separable in higher dimensions.\n",
